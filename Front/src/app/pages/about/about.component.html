        Hi! I'm Brexton Thomas, I’m a dedicated computer science student
        and aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for building efficient and meaningful digital solutions.
        As a proud father to my daughter Aria and a husband, I value discipline, balance, and continuous growth. Outside of technology,
        I enjoy playing video games, staying active at the gym, and following the world of cryptocurrency.
        My experience in the U.S. Army taught me resilience and leadership under pressure—skills I now apply to solving technical challenges.
        I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and collaborate on projects that have real-world impact.
        Whether working independently or as part of a team, I bring persistence, creativity, and a problem-solving mindset to everything I do.
